## Project Summary

Our project is a web application that will rely on a database from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics and will have many features involved to narrow down the data set and represent it in a palpable way for our intended audience to read. This mainly involved having functionality that includes filtering down the results and searching up different criterias such as Name, Country, Discipline, Gender and Age. We will achieve most of these queries using SQL and having a backend that will communicate with our dataset and present it in a frontend UI.
	Our project also has a main focus of using the skills we have learned in our class to efficiently query for more data that we need to present to our users. We plan on having a favoriting system as well to make sure that when a user saves a certain olympian or team that they can return to our web application and see their favorite aspects of the Olympics presented to them. We also plan to have a search procedure that can find data from our dataset using words that are found in a particular or multiple data points.
